## Abstract

One of the primary requirement for edge computing is allocation of edge computing resources for end users along with maintaining application services deployment flexibility for edge platform. An architecture enhancements in Long-Term Evolution (LTE) standards for Control and User Plane Separtion (CUPS) provides an effective means of achieving these goals. CUPS approach has been proven for edge deployemnts with commericial EPC solution partners on the Open Network Edge Services Software (Smart Edge Open) platform.  The interfaces required for CUPS integration and further implementation strategies for user plane selection and traffic steering towards edge applications are discussed in this paper.

## Introduction

Edge platforms were not considered during the initial release of the LTE network architecture by 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). The development of edge computing platforms, where computing resources are located in an access network close to an end user, was therefore an "add-on" solution. The leading standard addressing edge computing, the ETSI Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) standard [ETSI_2016](<https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/MEC/001_099/003/01.01.01_60/gs_MEC003v010101p.pdf>), does not specify the networking aspects of edge computing. However, they have published white papers (e.g., [ETSI_2018](<https://www.etsi.org/images/files/ETSIWhitePapers/etsi_wp24_MEC_deployment_in_4G_5G_FINAL.pdf>), [ETSI_2018a](<https://www.etsi.org/images/files/ETSIWhitePapers/etsi_wp28_mec_in_5G_FINAL.pdf>)) that suggest various approaches. Deployment of edge computing in the LTE environment remains network operator-dependent.

The standards for 5G networks (e.g., [3GPP 23.501](<https://www.3gpp.org/DynaReport/23501.htm>) provide a new set of functional enablers for the integration of edge compute platforms into the network. However, since LTE will be deployed for years to come, providing edge computing in LTE remains important. This is the focus of the present white paper.

As described in [ETSI_2018](<https://www.etsi.org/images/files/ETSIWhitePapers/etsi_wp24_MEC_deployment_in_4G_5G_FINAL.pdf>), solutions consist of either:

- attaching an edge platform to an eNodeB (referred to as "bump in the wire") or,
- attaching an edge platform to an Evolved Packet Core(EPC) or Packet Gateway(PGW) (referred to as "distributed EPC" or "distributed PGW")

In the bump-in-the-wire case, either part or all of the traffic from base stations must pass through the edge platform via the S1-U reference point. This ties an edge platform to an eNodeB, which makes compute functions such as load balancing among edge platforms difficult or impossible, and which also makes network functions such as charging and lawful intercept difficult or impossible. Nevertheless, it is possible that some applications that must reduce the number of hops from the base station to the edge application may require this option.

The distributed EPC case has more flexibility; an edge platform is attached to an EPC or PGW via the SGi reference point. This case is called "distributed" because 1) the EPC may be distributed into an Service Gateway(SGW) and PGW in implementation, and 2) the SGW, PGW, and edge platform may be co-located into physical hardware (e.g., server hosts) in various combinations, depending on the capacity of the host platforms and the number of network hops to be reduced. This is described in detail in [ETSI_2018](<https://www.etsi.org/images/files/ETSIWhitePapers/etsi_wp24_MEC_deployment_in_4G_5G_FINAL.pdf>).

## 4G LTE CUPS architectural aspects

3GPP Release 14 introduced a study item called "Control and User Plane Separation of EPC Nodes (CUPS)". As explained in [3GPP_CUPS](<https://www.3gpp.org/cups >), the motivation for this work was to keep up with the growth rate in user data traffic, which has been growing at 100%/year in recent years due to the proliferation of smart devices and the usage of video traffic. Reducing user plane latency and increasing throughput was a high priority. The study item responded with a specification in which the control and user planes of the EPC could be scaled flexibly.

CUPS is being adopted widely by network operators, making the integration of the CUPS architecture with edge computing a necessity. The most recent release of CUPS in Release 15, [3GPP_23214](<https://www.3gpp.org/DynaReport/23214.htm>), and a summary of its architecture can be found in [3GPP_CUPS](<https://www.3gpp.org/cups>).

The remainder of this white paper will focus on the CUPS architecture and its integration with edge computing platforms.

In CUPS, additional reference points (Sxa,  Sxb, and Sxc) between the corresponding control plane, user plane, and traffic detection functions of the EPC are defined. The Packet Forwarding Control Protocol (PFCP) runs on these reference points, allowing sessions to be set up between control plane and user plane elements. With some restrictions at initialization time, multiple sessions between control plane functions and user plane functions may be established. The Sx sessions establish the detection, forwarding, QoS, and DNS rules to be followed by the user plane functions. These rules determine the initial selection of an SGW-U when a UE is first attached, the destinations where user plane packets are routed by the user plane functions, and how user plane data streams may be buffered or throttled during the process.

Thus, the strategy for integrating an edge platform with a CUPS network is to coordinate the configuration rules established in the EPC user plane functions with the deployment of edge platform applications, so that the user plane functions are co-located with the corresponding edge platform.

The 3GPP standard describes multiple ways to select SGW-U and PGW-U during the UE initial attach or PDN connection establishment phases. The user has the flexibility to choose from multiple methods that best serve their Edge requirements. The implementation in Smart Edge Open presents a subset of those methods for a selection of user planes and for steering subscriber traffic to an appropriate user plane node (usually the closest), where the application data processing can be co-located with the gateway. The Access Point Name (APN) (or APN FQDN, per [3GPP_23003](<https://www.3gpp.org/DynaReport/23003.htm>)) can be used in the selection process of PGW-U. The selection of SGW-U can be based on the Traffic Area Code (TAC), which is based on the network topology and the current location of the subscriber.

## Integration with Edge Platform

The [previous section](#4G-LTE-CUPS-architectural-aspects) of this white paper described the networking environment in which an edge platform must be integrated. In this section, an integration with the Smart Edge Open edge computing platform is described.

### Open Network Edge Services Software (Smart Edge Open)

Smart Edge Open is an open-source edge computing platform that enables Service Providers and Enterprises to deploy applications and services on a network edge. It is inspired by the edge computing architecture defined by the ETSI Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) standards (e.g., [ETSI_MEC 003]), as well as the 5G network architecture ([3GPP_23501]).

Smart Edge Open is access network agnostic, as it provides an architecture that interoperates with LTE, 5G, WiFi\*, and wired networks. Smart Edge Open provides APIs that allow network orchestrators and edge computing controllers to configure routing policies uniformly.

Because it is an open-source platform, Smart Edge Open enables operators, Independant Software Vendors(ISVs), and OSVs to innovate with new technologies and services. Field trials may be run with platforms implemented via Smart Edge Open, or functionality from the Smart Edge Open platform may be imported into existing third-party products. Thus, Smart Edge Open is an attractive platform for investigating approaches to integration with a CUPS-based network. Refer to [Smart Edge Open documentation](https://www.openness.org/docs/doc/architecture) for more information on the Smart Edge Open platform.

Figure 1 shows the architecture of the Smart Edge Open platform. It consists of:

- a Controller through which external orchestrators act on the system and which is used to manage edge platforms
- one or more Edge Nodes, which host edge applications

In general, many edge nodes are associated with a Controller. To accomplish performance objectives, such as latency minimization, the edge node should be "close" in the network to a PGW-U. In the Smart Edge Open platform, the Controller establishes the appropriate configuration rules in the EPC functions.

The functional elements of the Smart Edge Open platform interact with each other via service interfaces. Of these, certain interfaces, such as those that interact with the access network or with edge applications, are exposed as OpenAPI (i.e., RESTful) APIs.

Refer to [Smart Edge Open documentation](https://www.openness.org/docs/doc/architecture) for a details of the architecture and the service interfaces.

### EPC Deployment Models and Integration with Edge Platforms

The 3GPP standards define many deployment scenarios for EPCs, which differ by the level of co-location within a platform. For CUPS, the choices of co-location of the user plane gateways are of interest because co-location provides opportunities for reducing the latency of a network.

To explore these alternatives, we will consider three different deployment models. In these models, it is assumed that the access network control plane is not impacted, but that the user plane is distributed in different configurations.

Figure 2 depicts the first, most decoupled model in which multiple SGW-Us are associated with a single PGW-U. The edge compute node is associated with the PGW-U, and the configurations of the multiple SGW-Us, the PGW-U, and the edge compute node must be coordinated so that the PGW-U is selected as a destination for the traffic from a particular UE. In this model, a network orchestration function configures the EPC elements and selects the edge node for the deployment of an edge application. In this model, the edge Controller function does not have visibility to the network.

![3GPP CUPS model 1](epc-images/smartedge-open_epc1.png)
Figure 2 - Deployment Model 1: Separate S-GW, Co-located P-GW, and Edge Platform

In the second deployment model, shown in Figure 3, the PGW-U is integrated into an edge infrastructure. This model implies that the PGW-U function runs as a bare metal server, a virutal machine(VM), or container implementation in the same host or rack as an edge node. The number of hops through the network for user plane traffic is reduced because it is now possible for the PGW-U function to be orchestrated by the same virtualization manager as the edge platform. However, to realize this economy, the control plane should expose an API by which the edge platform can configure it (e.g., by setting the forwarding, QoS, and DNS rules required by the SGW-U).

![3GPP CUPS model 2](epc-images/smartedge-open_epc2.png)
Figure 3 - Deployment Model 2: Combined S-GW, P-GW, Separate Edge Platform

In the third deployment model, shown in Figure 4, the SGW-U and PGW-U functions are integrated into the same platform as the edge node. This model looks like a single user plane gateway that also executes edge applications, which reduces latency and operational costs. The user plane functions may run in bare metal server, a VM, or containers managed by the edge platform virtualization manager. The control plane functions should expose an API by which the edge platform can configure it, as in the case of the second model.

![3GPP CUPS model 3](epc-images/smartedge-open_epc3.png)
Figure 4 - Combined S-GW, P-GW, Co-located with Edge Platform

### Smart Edge Open implementation

An implementation of the third deployment model was created to demonstrate the approach of integrating userplane gateways with an edge platform. Its high-level architecture is depicted in Figure 5.

The interacting functions in this architecture are the EPC Control Plane and the Smart Edge Open Controller.

The EPC Control Plane is a reference implementation of a 3GPP control plane. It exposes APIs for performing network configuration operations which can by used by the Core Network Configuration API (CNCA). Invocations of the EPC Control API's result in setting appropriate configuration rules in the LTE access network.

The Smart Edge Open Controller is a reference implementation that maintains a representation of requested UE traffic steering configuration, and issues configuration commands via the new API developed as a part of this integration (the CNCA API).

The combined user plane functions must still be subject to control by the operators' OAM interfaces. Because there is no standard interface defined for this reference point currently, it is assumed that the OAM will be customizable to use the APIs exposed by the Smart Edge Open Controller.

### Smart Edge Open API flows for CUPS integration

The following sequence diagrams show the API communication between the Edge Controller, the LTE Control Plane functions, and the Edge Node. These sequence diagrams follow the reference implementation carried out with Smart Edge Open, and they assume the combined user plane configuration (Deployment model 3). However, corresponding flows can be visualized for the other deployment models.

Figure 8 - Deleting a User Plane Configuration from Controller

In future work, the API endpoint specification will be further validated with one or more commercial EPC providers.

### API schema for the Core Network Configuration Agent (CNCA) Endpoint

The API is exposed via an HTTP REST API endpoint, "/userplanes". In Figure 6, it is exposed at the EPC Control Plane, but could also be exposed at the EPC User Plane (or SGW-U/PGW-U/Edge Node function).

The endpoint currently defines:

```bash
post: /userplanes
get: /userplanes
get: /userplanes/{id}
patch: /userplanes/{id}
delete: /userplanes/{id}
```

![LTE CUPS Configuration Sequence diagram 3](epc-images/smartedge-open_epc_cnca_1.png)

Figure 9 - Parameters of Core Network Configuration Agent (CNCA) API

The "id", "UUID", and "function" parameters are mandatory, and other parameters are optional and are used according to the semantics of the HTTP verbs that define the rest of the API invocation.

The above API parameters are grouped into three categories:

- **Config**: Configure Sxx related IP address of user plane. Since the EPC control plane can also learn these parameters through other means, whether these parameters are required is vendor-dependent.
- **Selectors**: Bind the user plane to APN, TAC, etc. in the control plane, so that UEs can be assigned to a particular user plane (PGW-U and/or SGW-U) at the time of connection establishment.
- **Entitlements**: Allow further levels of control in the gateway selection for UEs at the EPC Control plane through IMSIs. Instead of using IMSI directly, it is recommended to use some level of indirect reference of IMSIs (proprietary to the operator network) to identify UEs.

### Additional Recommended Semantics for Core Network Configuration Agent (CNCA) API

The previous section describes the parameters of the API. For additional control over traffic routing, additional policies are recommended:

- In addition to the APN (for PDN GW selection) and TAC (for S-GW selection), UE-level entitlements can be specified to refine the edge resources selected for a given flow. This is done from the Controller by specifying access control on edge compute resources.
- Though the Smart Edge Open API refers to International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) to identify UE uniquely, UE tagging is left as an implementation decision because it may not be desirable to expose IMSI information outside of the operator’s environment scope (e.g., for security).

Application data filtering functionality for processing at the edge can be further implemented in the PDN Gateway data pipeline itself to reduce the overhead of data processing in the Edge compute node data plane. Indeed, many EPC solutions already support application-level packet filtering and steering based on 5-tuples through proprietary implementations, which can be leveraged and extended for edge solutions.

## Validation and Data path models

The reference implementation described in this white paper has been tested in a lab environment. The following sections provide brief descriptions of these tests.

## UE to Application

Figure 10 depicts this test. This flow is a basic session between an application front-end on a UE, and an application back-end on an edge node.

- The UE indicates its desired APN, which reflects in the right PGW-U being selected. The network assigns the correct SGW-U based on the current TAC.
- The Subscriber’s application data is processed at the edge application launched at the Smart Edge Open Edge compute node.

![LTE CUPS Configuration test flow 1](epc-images/smartedge-open_epctest1.png)

Figure 10 - User Plane Routing between UE and Edge Application

### UE to Application to Internet

Figure 11 depicts this test. An example of this flow is a media stream from a web camera to a computer vision application on an edge node, which computes metadata from the media stream and forwards the metadata to the cloud.

- The UE indicates its desired APN, which reflects in the right PGW-U being selected. The network assigns the correct SGW-U based on the current TAC.
- The Subscriber’s application data is processed at the edge application launched at the Smart Edge Open Edge compute node.
- The application output is sent back to the PDN/internet for further processing.

![LTE CUPS Configuration test flow 2](epc-images/smartedge-open_epctest2.png)

Figure 11 - User Plane Routing UE - Edge Application - Internet

### UE traffic forwarding to the Internet from lack of Authentication

Figure 12 depicts this test. An example of this flow is a UE that attempts to use an edge application but is not authorized for it. For example, the user may be authorized to use the "best available service" QoS and run the application in the cloud but not to run a higher-performance version running on the edge node.

- The UE indicates its desired APN, which reflects in the right PGW-U being selected. The network assigns the correct SGW-U based on the current TAC.
- The Subscriber’s application data is not configured for Edge location processing and is therefore forwarded to the PDN/internet.

![LTE CUPS Configuration test flow 3](epc-images/smartedge-open_epctest3.png)

Figure 12 - User Plane Routing of Unauthenticated Traffic - UE to Internet

### Non-Edge Application Traffic

Figure 13 depicts this test. This is another default case where the UE matches no rules for an edge application and is treated as any other regular session that happens to be routed through the edge node EPC.

- The UE connects to a different User plane function because its location and/or APN configurations are different and are not in the Edge service location.
- The Subscriber’s application data, therefore, uses a different UPF to reach the PDN.

## Summary

This white paper describes an investigation of how an edge platform can be integrated in a LTE access network that supports CUPS. Such an integration is a key factor for achieving the performance goals of an edge platform. During the validation for illustrating this integration, EPC control plane was modified  to interact with Core Network Configuration Agent (CNCA) APIs from Smart Edge Open, through which an edge controller can configure the EPC. By doing this, a central control point (the Edge Controller) can coordinate the deployment of an edge application and the rules for steering UE data traffic to a specific edge application.

Further validation of this architecture will be carried out with commercial EPC partners.
