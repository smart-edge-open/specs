## Purpose

The Converged Edge Experience Kit is a refreshed repository of Ansible\* playbooks for automated deployment of Converged Edge Reference Architectures.

The Converged Edge Experience Kit introduces the following capabilities:
1. Wide range of deployments from individual building blocks to full end-to-end reference deployments
2. Minimal to near-zero user interventions.. Typically, the user provides the details of the nodes that constitute the Smart Edge Open edge cluster and executes the deployment script
3. More advanced deployments can be customized in the form of Ansible\* group and host variables. This mode requires users with in-depth knowledge and expertise of the subject edge deployment
4. Enablement of end-to-end multi-cluster deployments such as Near Edge and On-premises reference architectures

## Converged Edge Experience Kit explained
The Converged Edge Experience Kit repository is organized as detailed in the following structure:
```
├── cloud
├── flavors
├── inventory
│   ├── automated
│   └── default
│       ├── group_vars
│       │   └── all

```

* `flavors`: definition variables of pre-defined deployment flavors
* `inventory`: definition of default & generated Ansible\* variables
* `inventory/default/group_vars/all/10-default.yml`: definition of default variables for all deployments
* `inventory/automated`: inventory files that were automatically generated by the deployment helper script
* `playbooks`: Ansible\* playbooks for infrastructure, Kubernetes and applications
* `roles`: Ansible roles for infrastructure, Kubernetes, applications and telemetry
* `scripts`: utility scripts
* `inventory.yml`: definition of the clusters, their controller & edge nodes and respective deployment flavors
* `deploy.py`: the deployment helper script


## The inventory file
The inventory file defines the group of physical nodes that constitute the edge cluster which will be deployed by the Converged Edge Experience Kits. The inventory file YAML specification allows deploying multiple edge clusters in one command run. Multiple clusters must be separated by the 3 dashes `---` directive.

> **NOTE**: for multi-cluster deployments, user must assign distinct names to the controller and the edge nodes, i.e., no hostname repetitions.

The following variables must be defined 

* `cluster_name`: a given name for the Smart Edge Open edge cluster deployment - separated by underscores `_` instead of spaces.
* `flavor`: the deployment flavor applicable for the Smart Edge Open edge deployment as defined in the [Deployment flavors](../flavors.md) document.
* `single_node_deployment`: If set to `true`, a single-node cluster is deployed.. Must satisfy the following conditions:
  - IP address (`ansible_host`) for both controller and node must be the same
  - `controller_group` and `edgenode_group` groups must contain exactly one host
* `limit` -- **OPTIONAL**: constrains the deployment to a specific Ansible\* group, e.g., `controller`, `edgenode`, `edgenode_vca_group` or just a particular hostname. This is passed as a `--limit` command-line option when executing `ansible-playbook`.
* `ansible_user`: deployment will be done for provided user and that user will become kubernetes cluster admin

## Sample Deployment Definitions
### Single Cluster Deployment
Set `single_node_deployment` flag to `false` in the inventory file and provide the controller node name under the `controller_group` and the edge node names under the `edgenode_group`.

Example:

```yaml
---
all:
  vars:
    cluster_name: 5g_near_edge
    flavor: cera_5g_near_edge
    single_node_deployment: false
    limit:
controller_group:
  hosts:
    ctrl.openness.org:
      ansible_host: 10.102.227.154
      ansible_user: openness
edgenode_group:
  hosts:
    node01.openness.org:
      ansible_host: 10.102.227.11
      ansible_user: openness
    node02.openness.org:
      ansible_host: 10.102.227.79
      ansible_user: openness
edgenode_vca_group:
  hosts:
ptp_master:
  hosts:
ptp_slave_group:
  hosts:
```

### Single-node Cluster Deployment
Set `single_node_deployment` flag to `true` in the inventory file and provide the node name in the `controller_group` and the `edgenode_group`.

Example:

```yaml
---
all:
  vars:
    cluster_name: 5g_central_office
    flavor: cera_5g_central_office
    single_node_deployment: true   
    limit:  
controller_group:
  hosts:
    node.openness.org:
      ansible_host: 10.102.227.234
      ansible_user: openness
edgenode_group:
  hosts:
    node.openness.org:
      ansible_host: 10.102.227.234
      ansible_user: openness
edgenode_vca_group:
  hosts:
ptp_master:
  hosts:
ptp_slave_group:
  hosts:
```

### Multi-cluster deployment
Provide multiple clusters YAML specifications separated by the 3 dashes `---` directive in the inventory.yml. A node name should be used only once across the inventory file, i.e: distinct node names.

Example:

```yaml
---
all:
  vars:
    cluster_name: 5g_near_edge
    flavor: cera_5g_near_edge
    single_node_deployment: true 
    limit:
controller_group:
  hosts:
    node.openness01.org:
      ansible_host: 10.102.227.154
      ansible_user: openness
edgenode_group:
  hosts:
    node.openness01.org:
      ansible_host: 10.102.227.154
      ansible_user: openness
edgenode_vca_group:
  hosts:
ptp_master:
  hosts:
ptp_slave_group:
  hosts:
---
all:
  vars:
    cluster_name: 5g_central_office
    flavor: cera_5g_central_office
    single_node_deployment: true   
    limit:  
controller_group:
  hosts:
    node.openness02.org:
      ansible_host: 10.102.227.234
      ansible_user: openness
edgenode_group:
  hosts:
    node.openness02.org:
      ansible_host: 10.102.227.234
      ansible_user: openness
edgenode_vca_group:
  hosts:
ptp_master:
  hosts:
ptp_slave_group:
  hosts:
```

## Deployment customization
The `deploy.py` script creates a new inventory for each cluster to be deployed in a `inventory/automated` directory. These inventories are based on `inventory/default` - all directories and files are symlinked. Additionally, relevant flavor files are symlinked.

Customizations made to `inventory/default/group_vars` and `inventory/default/host_vars` will affect every deployment performed by `deploy.py` (because these files are symlinked, not copied). Therefore it is a good place to provide changes relevant to the nodes of the cluster.

## Customizing kernel, grub parameters, and tuned profile & variables per host

CEEKs allow a user to customize kernel, grub parameters, and tuned profiles by leveraging Ansible's feature of `host_vars`.

> **NOTE**: `inventory/default/groups_vars/[edgenode|controller|edgenode_vca]_group` directories contain variables applicable for the respective groups and they can be used in `inventory/default/host_vars` to change on per node basis while `inventory/default/group_vars/all` contains cluster wide variables.

CEEKs contain a `inventory/default/host_vars/` directory in which we can create another directory (`nodes-inventory-name`) and place a YAML file (`10-default.yml`, e.g., `node01/10-default.yml`). The file would contain variables that would override roles' default values.

> **NOTE**: Despite the ability to customize parameters (kernel), it is required to have a clean CentOS\* 7.9.2009 operating system installed on hosts (from a minimal ISO image) that will be later deployed from Ansible scripts. This OS shall not have any user customizations.

To override the default value, place the variable's name and new value in the host's vars file. For example, the contents of `inventory/default/host_vars/node01/10-default.yml` that would result in skipping kernel customization on that node:

```yaml
kernel_skip: true
```

The following are several common customization scenarios.

### IP address range allocation for various CNIs and interfaces

The Converged Edge Experience kits deployment uses/allocates/reserves a set of IP address ranges for different CNIs and interfaces. The server or host IP address should not conflict with the default address allocation.
In case if there is a critical need for the server IP address used by the Smart Edge Open default deployment, it would require to modify the default addresses used by the Smart Edge Open.

Following files specify the CIDR for CNIs and interfaces. These are the IP address ranges allocated and used by default just for reference.

```yaml
flavors/media-analytics-vca/all.yml:19:vca_cidr: "172.32.1.0/12"
inventory/default/group_vars/all/10-default.yml:90:calico_cidr: "10.245.0.0/16"
inventory/default/group_vars/all/10-default.yml:93:flannel_cidr: "10.244.0.0/16"
inventory/default/group_vars/all/10-default.yml:96:weavenet_cidr: "10.32.0.0/12"
inventory/default/group_vars/all/10-default.yml:99:kubeovn_cidr: "10.16.0.0/16,100.64.0.0/16,10.96.0.0/12"
roles/kubernetes/cni/kubeovn/controlplane/templates/crd_local.yml.j2:13:  cidrBlock: "192.168.{{ loop.index0 + 1 }}.0/24"
```

The `192.168.*.*` is used for SRIOV and interface service IP address allocation in Kube-ovn CNI. So it is not allowed for the server IP address, which conflicting with this range.
Completely avoid the range of address defined as per the netmask as it may conflict in routing rules.

E.g., If the server/host IP address is required to use `192.168.*.*` while this range by default used for SRIOV interfaces in Smart Edge Open. The IP address range for `cidrBlock` in `roles/kubernetes/cni/kubeovn/controlplane/templates/crd_local.yml.j2` file can be changed to `192.167.{{ loop.index0 + 1 }}.0/24` to use some other IP segment for SRIOV interfaces.


### Default values
Here are several default values:

```yaml
# --- machine_setup/custom_kernel
kernel_skip: false  # use this variable to disable custom kernel installation for host

kernel_repo_url: http://linuxsoft.cern.ch/cern/centos/7.9.2009/rt/CentOS-RT.repo
kernel_repo_key: http://linuxsoft.cern.ch/cern/centos/7.9.2009/os/x86_64/RPM-GPG-KEY-cern
kernel_package: kernel-rt-kvm
kernel_devel_package: kernel-rt-devel
kernel_version: 3.10.0-1160.11.1.rt56.1145.el7.x86_64

kernel_dependencies_urls: []
kernel_dependencies_packages: []

# --- machine_setup/grub
hugepage_size: "2M" # Or 1G
hugepage_amount: "5000"

default_grub_params: "hugepagesz={{ hugepage_size }} hugepages={{ hugepage_amount }} intel_iommu=on iommu=pt"
additional_grub_params: ""

# --- machine_setup/configure_tuned
tuned_skip: false   # use this variable to skip tuned profile configuration for host
tuned_packages:
  - tuned-2.11.0-9.el7
  - http://ftp.scientificlinux.org/linux/scientific/7/x86_64/os/Packages/tuned-profiles-realtime-2.11.0-9.el7.noarch.rpm
tuned_profile: realtime
tuned_vars: |
  isolated_cores=2-3
  nohz=on
  nohz_full=2-3
```

### Use different realtime kernel (3.10.0-1062)
By default, `kernel-rt-kvm-3.10.0-1160.11.1.rt56.1145.el7.x86_64` from the built-in repository is installed.

To use another version (e.g., `kernel-rt-kvm-3.10.0-1062.9.1.rt56.1033.el7.x86_64`), create a `host_var` file for the host with content:
```yaml
kernel_version: 3.10.0-1062.9.1.rt56.1033.el7.x86_64
```

### Use different non-rt kernel (3.10.0-1062)
The CEEK installs a real-time kernel by default. However, the non-rt kernel is present in the official CentOS repository. Therefore, to use a different non-rt kernel, the following overrides must be applied:
```yaml
kernel_repo_url: ""                           # package is in default repository, no need to add new repository
kernel_package: kernel                        # instead of kernel-rt-kvm
kernel_devel_package: kernel-devel            # instead of kernel-rt-devel
kernel_version: 3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64

dpdk_kernel_devel: ""  # kernel-devel is in the repository, no need for url with RPM

# Since, we're not using rt kernel, we don't need a tuned-profiles-realtime but want to keep the tuned 2.11
tuned_packages:
- http://linuxsoft.cern.ch/scientific/7x/x86_64/os/Packages/tuned-2.11.0-8.el7.noarch.rpm
tuned_profile: balanced
tuned_vars: ""
```

### Use tuned 2.9
```yaml
tuned_packages:
- tuned-2.9.0-1.el7fdp
- tuned-profiles-realtime-2.9.0-1.el7fdp
```

### Default kernel and configure tuned
```yaml
kernel_skip: true     # skip kernel customization altogether

# update tuned to 2.11 but don't install tuned-profiles-realtime since we're not using rt kernel
tuned_packages:
- http://linuxsoft.cern.ch/scientific/7x/x86_64/os/Packages/tuned-2.11.0-8.el7.noarch.rpm
tuned_profile: balanced
tuned_vars: ""
```

### Change amount of HugePages
```yaml
hugepage_amount: "1000"   # default is 5000
```

### Change size of HugePages
```yaml
hugepage_size: "1G"   # default is 2M
```

### Change amount and size of HugePages
```yaml
hugepage_amount: "10"   # default is 5000
hugepage_size: "1G"     # default is 2M
```

### Remove input output memory management unit (IOMMU) from grub params
```yaml
default_grub_params: "hugepagesz={{ hugepage_size }} hugepages={{ hugepage_amount }}"
```

### Add custom GRUB parameter
```yaml
additional_grub_params: "debug"
```

### Configure OVS-DPDK in kube-ovn
By default, OVS-DPDK is disabled (due to set calico as a default cni). To enable it, set a flag:
```yaml
kubeovn_dpdk: true
```

> **NOTE**: This flag should be set in `roles/kubernetes/cni/kubeovn/common/defaults/main.ym` or added to `inventory/default/group_vars/all/10-default.yml`.

Additionally, HugePages in the OVS pod can be adjusted once default HugePage settings are changed.
```yaml
kubeovn_dpdk_socket_mem: "1024,0" # Amount of hugepages reserved for OVS per NUMA node (node 0, node 1, ...) in MB
kubeovn_dpdk_hugepage_size: "2Mi" # Default size of hugepages, can be 2Mi or 1Gi
kubeovn_dpdk_hugepages: "1Gi"     # Total amount of hugepages that can be used by OVS-OVN pod
```

> **NOTE**: If the machine has multiple NUMA nodes, remember that HugePages must be allocated for **each NUMA node**. For example, if a machine has two NUMA nodes, `kubeovn_dpdk_socket_mem: "1024,1024"` or similar should be specified.

>**NOTE**: If `kubeovn_dpdk_socket_mem` is changed, set the value of `kubeovn_dpdk_hugepages` to be equal to or greater than the sum of `kubeovn_dpdk_socket_mem` values. For example, for `kubeovn_dpdk_socket_mem: "1024,1024"`, set `kubeovn_dpdk_hugepages` to at least `2Gi` (equal to 2048 MB).

>**NOTE**: `kubeovn_dpdk_socket_mem`, `kubeovn_dpdk_pmd_cpu_mask`, and `kubeovn_dpdk_lcore_mask` can be set on per node basis but the HugePage amount allocated with `kubeovn_dpdk_socket_mem` cannot be greater than `kubeovn_dpdk_hugepages`, which is the same for the whole cluster.

OVS pods limits are configured by:
```yaml
kubeovn_dpdk_resources_requests: "1Gi" # OVS-OVN pod RAM memory (requested)
kubeovn_dpdk_resources_limits: "1Gi"   # OVS-OVN pod RAM memory (limit)
```
CPU settings can be configured using:
```yaml
kubeovn_dpdk_pmd_cpu_mask: "0x4" # DPDK PMD CPU mask
kubeovn_dpdk_lcore_mask: "0x2"   # DPDK lcore mask
```

## Adding new CNI plugins for Kubernetes (Network Edge)

* The role that handles CNI deployment must be placed in the `roles/kubernetes/cni/` directory (e.g., `roles/kubernetes/cni/kube-ovn/`).
* Subroles for control plane and node (if needed) should be placed in the `controlplane/` and `node/` directories (e.g., `roles/kubernetes/cni/kube-ovn/{controlplane,node}`).
* If there is a part of common command for both control plane and node, additional sub-roles can be created: `common` (e.g., `roles/kubernetes/cni/sriov/common`).<br>
>**NOTE**: The automatic inclusion of the `common` role should be handled by Ansible mechanisms (e.g., usage of meta's `dependencies` or `include_role` module)
* Name of the main role must be added to the `available_kubernetes_cnis` variable in `roles/kubernetes/cni/defaults/main.yml`.
* If additional requirements must checked before running the playbook (to not have errors during execution), they can be placed in the `roles/kubernetes/cni/tasks/precheck.yml` file, which is included as a pre_task in plays for both Edge Controller and Edge Node.<br>
The following are basic prechecks that are currently executed:
  * Check if any CNI is requested (i.e., `kubernetes_cni` is not empty).
  * Check if `sriov` is not requested as primary (first on the list) or standalone (only on the list).
  * Check if `calico` is requested as a primary (first on the list).
  * Check if `kubeovn` is requested as a primary (first on the list).
  * Check if the requested CNI is available (check if some CNI is requested that isn't present in the `available_kubernetes_cnis` list).
* CNI roles should be as self-contained as possible (unless necessary, CNI-specific tasks should not be present in `kubernetes/{controlplane,node,common}` or `openness/network_edge/{controlplane,node}`).
* If the CNI needs a custom Smart Edge Open service (e.g., Interface Service in case of `kube-ovn`), it can be added to the `openness/network_edge/{controlplane,node}`.<br>
  Preferably, such tasks would be contained in a separate task file (e.g., `roles/openness/controlplane/tasks/kube-ovn.yml`) and executed only if the CNI is requested. For example:
  ```yaml
  - name: deploy interface service for kube-ovn
    include_tasks: kube-ovn.yml
    when: "'kubeovn' in kubernetes_cnis"
  ```
* If the CNI is used as an additional CNI (with Multus\*), the network attachment definition must be supplied ([refer to Multus docs for more info](https://github.com/intel/multus-cni/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md#storing-a-configuration-as-a-custom-resource)).
